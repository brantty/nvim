## About

This is my neovim config I have curated for about two years now. I use it for
Angular, NestJS, and now Vue.

I plan to improve this readme to give a better overview of my config.

If you have any questions about how something works, don't hesitate to open
an issue or send me a message!

## Todo

- [ ] Migrate from `null-ls` (RIP).
- [ ] Look at [ultimate-autopairs]
      (<https://github.com/altermo/ultimate-autopair.nvim>).
- [ ] Figure out why in the `cmp` setup, lua lsp is complaining about undefined
      fields. I think it has something to do with `null-ls`.
- [ ] Refactor `Help`, `HelpGrep`, and `HelpWord` user commands.
- [ ] After .10 release `OpenTerminal...` scaling user commands by not be
      necessary.
- [ ] Create `cmp` source for `primeflex`
